            <h2>Early Stages: Trade-Off Analysis and Price Elasticity</h2>
            
            <p>
                At the outset of my tenure with Loblaw Companies Limited, a key focus area was optimizing pricing strategies to balance profit margins with customer acquisition and retention.
                In a traditional retail landscape prior to the use of advanced analytics, pricing decisions were made heuristically based on several factors, but primarily driven by competitor pricing. 
                Coming out of my Master's degree in Analytics, I was keen to apply my knowledge in statistics and decision sciences to provide support to pricing teams to help them make more sound decisions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After spending some time understanding the business context in which decisions were made, I had 3 primary observations.
                The first was the differences in pricing recommendations by different analysts across the same product, highlighting a lack of consistency in approach.
                The second was the amount of time taken to perform such analyses, which hindered business execution in a rapid retail environment.
                Lastly, I observed that the existing methodologies for pricing analysis and decision making were not scalable. 
                It became evident to me that a more systematic, data driven approach was necessary to handle the complexity more effectively and ultimately empower pricing managers to make more informed decisions swiftly.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Approach to Trade-Off Analysis</h3>
            <p>
               <h4>Development of a VBA tool for data analysis</h4>
               <p>Recognizing that analysts primarily used Excel for their work, I embarked on developing a VBA-based tool to streamline and automate the data analysis process.
                Despite not having any prior experience with VBA, I knew it would be crucial to create a solution that would integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow knowing that stakeholder buy in 
                would be crucial to the success of the work. 
               </p>

               <h4>Data Ingestion and Cleanup</h4>
               <p>I wrote scripts in VBA that performed data cleanup, handling anomalies in the data and standardizing data types. It was crucial to ensure data integrity for accurate analysis.
                The script also generated aggregate forms of the data, setting the foundation for deeper analysis and visualizations which could then be presented to key stakeholders as part of the analysis.
               </p>

               <h4>Time Series Analysis and Price Demand Curves</h4>
               <p>After the scripts generated the data required, I layered time series analysis and created price demand curves. This was critical in understanding price changes and impact on consumer demand.
                A great deal of this work led to more pointed discussions around what was working and what was not.
               </p>

               <h4>Optimization Framework</h4>
               <p>At the heart of this work was an optimization framework that allowed users to maximize sales, margin or quantity based on their input. The role of a pricing manager was diverse and often 
                they were required to balance multiple KPIs depending on the business trajectory, adding additional complexity to pricing. Having this flexibility meant that the tool could adapt to various strategic goals,
                providing recommendations for different scenarios.
               </p>

               <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
               <p>Finally, once all the nuts and bolts were created, I ensured that the tool would output synthesize all the various data analysis in a form that was ready to be put in presentation form.
                This step significantly reduced analysts time to preparing key findings and meant they could instead spend that time focusing on gathering actionable insights. 
               </p>
            </p>
        
            <h3>Challenges and Initial Insights</h3>
            <p>
                One of the initial challenges was segmenting products accurately based on their elasticity. The vast array of products offered by Loblaw required a nuanced understanding of different customer segments and buying patterns. Early insights revealed that a one-size-fits-all pricing strategy was not effective. It became apparent that a more granular, category-specific approach was needed to optimize pricing across the board.
