            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved developing sophisticated customer segmentation models. The goal was to classify our diverse customer base into distinct groups based on various behavioral and demographic criteria, thereby enabling more targeted marketing strategies and personalized experiences.

            <h2>Methodology and Tools</h2>
            <p>
                The segmentation models were built using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. We utilized tools such as Python and R for data processing, feature engineering, and model training. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and decision trees were some of the key methods employed.
