            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Early in my career at Loblaw, I built measurement frameworks for in-app loyalty offers to assess performance, employing various modeling techniques for a holistic view of the loyalty program. Later at Kijiji, I led the integration of an end-to-end A/B testing framework that significantly enhanced product testing capabilities, enabling the execution of 50+ tests per quarter across web and app platforms.

        <!-- Experiment Design and Execution -->
        <div class="experiment-design">
            <h2>Experiment Design and Execution</h2>
            <p>
                At Loblaw, my focus was on designing experiments with test and control groups, as well as pre-post analysis, using statistical testing to measure significance. In Kijiji, I furthered this approach by implementing power testing for sample size determination, automating SQL query generation, and establishing a comprehensive reporting system.

        <!-- Data Analysis and Insights -->
        <div class="data-analysis">
            <h2>Data Analysis and Insights</h2>
            <p>
                My role involved in-depth data analysis, extracting meaningful insights to inform business decisions. This included supplementary KPIs and metrics assessment at Loblaw and managing a GitHub repository at Kijiji to maintain a clean record of all historical tests and insights into overall product success rates.

        <!-- Challenges and Solutions -->
        <div class="challenges-solutions">
            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                A significant challenge was scaling the A/B testing framework to accommodate diverse product lines and customer segments at Kijiji. I developed a flexible framework to adapt to various business scenarios, enhancing the efficacy of product testing and decision-making processes.

            <h2>Reflections and Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                These experiences underscored the importance of data-driven strategies in both assessing loyalty program performance and enhancing product development. They highlighted the need for effective communication, collaboration, and the continuous evolution of testing methodologies to align with business objectives and market dynamics.
