            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In a product driven organization, the role of experimentation is pivotal in guiding decision making and making incremental improvements to the product itself.
              While the essence of testing lies in providing empirical evidence surrounding the feature, change or enhancements; the true value of any experimentation framework is realized 
              when it is conducted with precision and scalability. While in my previous capacity, I developed frameworks for testing, my full knowledge of experimentation was tested heavily at Kijiji.
              This project involved integrating an in-house python framework to scale testing and providing accurate results to the business around testing.

                The stages of testing in an experimentation framework can be broadly categorized into design, execution, and analysis. 
                The design phase is arguably most critical as it involves setting clear measurable objectives, selecting appropriate metrics, and ensuring the test is statistically sound. 
                An important part of this phase involved conducting power tests to accurately determine the appropriate sample size and the duration of each test. This helped to ensure statistical significance and reliability of results.
                During the execution phase, my role, alongside the analytics team was to help the tech teams in configuring the tests and subsequently preparing the results. When I first joined the organization, this process was done independently by analysts and often took many hours to complete. 
                As previously mentioned, a key part of this work involved integrating a more scalable framework. To do this, a testing package coined Fisher was integrated into the teams workflow. 
                This package would take a set of inputs of metrics, write the query to extract data from our ETLs, run a suite of statistical tests and generated standardized HTML reports. 
                This work significantly scaled the teams capacity to run tests, saving on average 10 hours of work per analyst. This efficiency gain increased the throughput of experimentation and accelerated the product development cycle.
                Moreover, documentation around product tests significantly improved as we were more easily able to measure our testing success rate and facilitated more informed discussions about experiment outcomes.

            <h2>Reflections and Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                Reflecting on this project, I realized the immense value of integrating automated tools to improve scalability and reliability. 
                This experience underscored the importance of continuous learning and adapting to evolving technologies in data science.
                It also reinforced my belief that if you think that a process can be improved, it often can be, and exploring the potential solutions can lead to significant advancements.
