            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Faced with the challenge of disparate event management across various platforms, I spearheaded the design and implementation of a user input form in AppScript. This form centralized the management of all front-end events, ensuring consistency and accuracy in our Google Analytics data.

            <h2>Solution Design and Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                The solution involved creating a streamlined process for event management, making it easier for teams to input and track events. The user-friendly interface facilitated efficient and accurate event logging.

        <!-- Monitoring System and Alerting -->
        <div class="monitoring-system">
            <h2>Monitoring System and Alerting</h2>
            <p>
                Alongside the input form, I developed an end-to-end monitoring system using Spark. This system provided real-time oversight of all events and was crucial in quickly identifying any discrepancies or issues. Additionally, I set up an alerting mechanism that integrated with Slack, ensuring prompt notification and response to significant events impacting key business metrics.

                The implementation of this system significantly improved the efficiency of event management and data reliability. The proactive alerting system enabled swift action to be taken when critical metrics were affected, thereby reducing potential business impacts.
