        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <div class="project-overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project was centered on enhancing the forecasting capabilities within the organization. By implementing a range of sophisticated models, we aimed to improve the accuracy and reliability of our predictions for various business metrics and experiment outcomes.

        <!-- Model Implementation and Techniques -->
        <div class="model-implementation">
            <h2>Model Implementation and Techniques</h2>
            <p>
                The implementation process involved selecting and fine-tuning several forecasting models to suit our specific data and business needs. ARIMA, Bayesian Time Series, and Prophet models were key in this repertoire, each offering unique strengths in handling different types of time series data.
