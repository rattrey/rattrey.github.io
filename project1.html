            <h2>Early Stages: Trade-Off Analysis and Price Elasticity</h2>
            
            <p>
                At the outset of my tenure with Loblaw Companies Limited, a key focus area was optimizing pricing strategies to balance profit margins with customer acquisition and retention. In the retail industry, particularly in a competitive market like Canada, understanding and effectively managing the delicate balance of pricing is crucial for business success.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Approach to Trade-Off Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                My initial approach involved conducting comprehensive trade-off analyses. This involved examining various pricing scenarios to determine their impact on key business metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and customer perception. Utilizing a combination of internal sales data, market research, and historical pricing trends, I applied statistical techniques to analyze how different price points could affect consumer buying behavior. Tools like Python and SQL were instrumental in aggregating and analyzing this data.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Price Elasticity Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                A critical aspect of this analysis was understanding price elasticity of demand â€“ how sensitive customers are to price changes. Identifying the elasticity of various products enabled us to predict how a change in price would impact demand and overall sales. For example, by analyzing sales data of key product categories, I was able to classify products into different elasticity bands. Essentials like dairy products showed inelastic demand, meaning price changes had minimal impact on sales volume, whereas non-essential luxury items exhibited higher elasticity.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Challenges and Initial Insights</h3>
            <p>
                One of the initial challenges was segmenting products accurately based on their elasticity. The vast array of products offered by Loblaw required a nuanced understanding of different customer segments and buying patterns. Early insights revealed that a one-size-fits-all pricing strategy was not effective. It became apparent that a more granular, category-specific approach was needed to optimize pricing across the board.
